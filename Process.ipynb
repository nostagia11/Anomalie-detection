    "The metrics you're seeing are typical performance indicators for a linear regression model. Let's break down each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `2.51`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is**: MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values. It tells you how far off your predictions are, on average, in the same units as the target variable (in this case, `Median` values).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interpretation**: On average, your model's predictions are off by **2.51 units** from the true values. A lower MAE indicates a better fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `8.14`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is**: MSE is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones because the differences are squared. It's sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interpretation**: The model's average error, when squared, is **8.14**. Since MSE emphasizes larger errors more, this can sometimes make it less interpretable directly than MAE, but it’s useful for understanding the variance of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **R² (R-squared)**: `-0.358`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it is**: R² represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",
    "  - **R² = 1** means perfect predictions (model explains 100% of the variance).\n",
    "  - **R² = 0** means the model doesn't explain any variance, and it performs no better than just predicting the mean of the target.\n",
    "  - **R² < 0** indicates that the model is worse than predicting the mean, meaning your model is not fitting the data well and might be overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: An R² of `-0.358` means your model is **worse than simply predicting the mean value of `Median`**. It doesn't capture the relationship well, and it suggests that the linear regression model doesn't fit the data effectively. Negative values of R² generally indicate that your model is not suitable for the data or that there's a mismatch between the data and the model assumptions (e.g., linearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Performance**: Based on these results, the model is performing poorly. The MAE and MSE are relatively high, and the negative R² indicates that the model is underperforming when compared to just predicting the average value of `Median`. \n",
    "- **Potential Issues**: There might be issues with the data (e.g., non-linear relationships, outliers) or with the features being used. A few possible next steps:\n",
    "  - **Check for linearity**: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship. If the data is non-linear, a different model (e.g., polynomial regression or decision trees) might be more suitable.\n",
    "  - **Feature Engineering**: You might need additional features or better-preprocessed data.\n",
    "  - **Model Choice**: Consider testing other regression models (e.g., decision tree regressor, random forest regressor) to see if they can better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Visualize the Data**: Plot the data to check for trends or patterns that linear regression might not capture.\n",
    "2. **Try Polynomial Regression**: If the data has a non-linear trend, try fitting a polynomial regression model instead.\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Investigate whether additional features might improve the model's performance."
